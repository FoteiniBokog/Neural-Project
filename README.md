#Excersice1
In the first exercise we built two classifiers based on the multilevel perceptron (MLP). Program Π1 implements MLP with two hidden levels and program Π2 implements MLP with three hidden levels, 
while in both programs the gradient descent training algorithm was used.

#Excersice2
In the second exercise we built a clustering program Π3 with M groups based on the k-means algorithm.
